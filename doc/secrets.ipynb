    "When I was in college in the early 70s, I devised what I believed was a brilliant encryption scheme. A simple pseudorandom number stream was added to the plaintext stream to create ciphertext. This would seemingly thwart any frequency analysis of the ciphertext, and would be uncrackable even to the most resourceful government intelligence agencies. I felt so smug about my achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Years later, I discovered this same scheme in several introductory cryptography texts and tutorial papers. How nice. Other cryptographers had thought of the same scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme was presented as a simple homework assignment on how to use elementary cryptanalytic techniques to trivially crack it. So much for my brilliant scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this humbling experience I learned how easy it is to fall into a false sense of security when devising an encryption algorithm. Most people donâ€™t realize how fiendishly difficult it is to devise an encryption algorithm that can withstand a prolonged and determined attack by a resourceful opponent."

    "The work factor is essentially the number of iterations of the hashing algorithm that are performed for each password (usually it's actually 2^work iterations). The purpose of the work factor is to make calculating the hash more computationally expensive, which in turn reduces the speed at which an attacker can attempt to crack the password hash. The work factor is typically stored in the hash output.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a work factor, a balance needs to be struck between security and performance. Higher work factors will make the hashes more difficult for an attacker to crack, but will also make the process of verifying a login attempt slower. If the work factor is too high, this may degrade the performance of the application, and could also be used by an attacker to carry out a denial of service attack by making a large number of login attempts to exhaust the server's CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no golden rule for the ideal work factor - it will depend on the performance of the server and the number of users on the application. Determining the optimal work factor will require experimentation on the specific server(s) used by the application. As a general rule, calculating a hash should take less than one second, although on higher traffic sites it should be significantly less than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrading the Work FactorÂ¶\n",
    "One key advantage of having a work factor is that it can be increased over time as hardware becomes more powerful and cheaper. Taking Moore's Law (i.e, that computational power at a given price point doubles every eighteen months) as a rough approximation, this means that the work factor should be increased by 1 every eighteen months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach to upgrading the work factor is to wait until the user next authenticates, and then to re-hash their password with the new work factor. This means that different hashes will have different work factors, and may result in hashes never being upgraded if the user doesn't log back in to the application. Depending on the application, it may be appropriate to remove the older password hashes and require users to reset their passwords next time they need to login, in order to avoid storing older and less secure hashes."
